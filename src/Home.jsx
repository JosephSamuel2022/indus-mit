			<h1 className='title'>The Indus Civilization</h1>
			<div className='content'>
				<p>
					The Indus civilization, also known as the Mature Harappan
					civilization, thrived from approximately 2500 to 1900 BCE in what is
					now Pakistan and northwestern India, covering a vast area of about a
					million square kilometers. This ancient civilization was characterized
					by urbanization, with large planned cities like Harappa and
					Mohenjo-daro at its core. Evidence of craft specialization and
					long-distance trade, particularly with Mesopotamia and Central Asia,
					underscores its advanced socioeconomic structure. Despite its
					prominence, the civilization met its demise in the early 2nd
					millennium BCE.
				</p>
				<p>
					Historical records of the Indus civilization were nonexistent until
					archaeological excavations in the late 19th and early 20th centuries
					unearthed artifacts and the remnants of urban centers. Among these
					discoveries were various objects, notably seals, adorned with
					sequences of symbols or signs. These inscriptions were found not only
					on seals but also on miniature tablets, pottery, and metal implements.
					Given the civilization's sophistication and social complexity,
					scholars have interpreted these inscriptions as a form of writing,
					indicative of a need for communication and coordination within the
					society.
				</p>
				<p>
					Despite numerous attempts, the decipherment of the Indus script has
					remained elusive. Unlike the Rosetta Stone, which played a pivotal
					role in deciphering Egyptian hieroglyphs by providing bilingual texts,
					no comparable key has been found for the Indus script. Furthermore,
					the lack of knowledge about the underlying language encoded by the
					signs poses a significant obstacle to decipherment efforts.
				</p>
				<p>
					Scholars generally agree that the Indus script was predominantly
					written from right to left, although some examples exhibit variations
					such as left-to-right, top-to-bottom, or boustrophedon (alternating
					directions). The inscriptions consist of a few hundred unique signs,
					ruling out conventional writing systems such as alphabetic or syllabic
					systems due to their limited number of signs. However, the number of
					signs aligns with logo-syllabic systems like Sumerian cuneiform, which
					utilized around 900 distinct signs.
				</p>
				<p>
					The brevity of the Indus inscriptions, with the longest sequences
					containing only thirteen signs, and the occurrence of numerous signs
					with low frequency, have led to alternative interpretations. Some
					suggest that the signs may function as personal labels or heraldic
					badges, akin to modern-day emblems denoting ownership or identity.
					Others propose a ritual or religious significance for the signs, akin
					to symbolic emblems found in other ancient artifacts.
				</p>
				<p>
					One intriguing possibility is that the Indus script lacks syntactic
					structure altogether, serving as symbolic or ritualistic elements
					devoid of linguistic meaning. This hypothesis suggests that the signs
					may not encode speech or serve mnemonic purposes, akin to the Vinca
					signs or emblems found in Near Eastern artifacts. Testing this
					hypothesis requires a rigorous examination of the sign sequences
					without presupposing their linguistic significance.
				</p>
				<p>
					In conclusion, the decipherment of the Indus script remains an ongoing
					challenge due to the lack of bilingual texts and the complexity of the
					underlying language. Despite various interpretations, including the
					possibility of non-linguistic symbolism, the true nature and purpose
					of the Indus inscriptions continue to elude scholars. Further research
					and interdisciplinary collaboration are essential to unraveling the
					mysteries of this ancient writing system and shedding light on the
					civilization that produced it..

# Overview
This project presents a pioneering methodology for unraveling the mysteries of the enigmatic Indus script, employing advanced computational linguistic techniques in tandem with the Interactive Corpus of Indus Texts (ICIT).

# Abstract
Through a multifaceted approach centered on positional n-gram analysis, clustering algorithms, and comparative studies with Tamil Brahmi, we delve deeply into the structural and symbolic complexities of the script. Our meticulous examination unveils nuanced insights into the distribution, significance, and syntactic relationships of symbols, including the identification of circular symbols with potential ties to celestial phenomena or rudimentary punctuation marks. Network-based analysis is also used to decipher results. By harnessing probabilistic models, multi-sequence alignment, and grammar analysis techniques, we uncover underlying grammar patterns and structural similarities among symbols, providing novel perspectives on the script's linguistic mysteries.

This interdisciplinary endeavor marks a significant milestone in decipherment efforts, offering innovative methodologies and insights for advancing research in ancient linguistics and archaeology, notably pioneering the application of clustering algorithms to the Indus script. Our findings not only contribute to ongoing decipherment endeavors but also shed new light on one of humanity's oldest linguistic puzzles. Through our comprehensive analysis conducted on the ICIT comprising 694 symbols, we offer a robust foundation for understanding the Indus script.
